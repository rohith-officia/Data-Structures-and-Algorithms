# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my **DSA practice repository**!  
This repo contains my solutions to problems from **LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks, and other coding platforms**, written in **Java**.  
The goal is to **master problem-solving, strengthen core CS fundamentals, and prepare for technical interviews**.
